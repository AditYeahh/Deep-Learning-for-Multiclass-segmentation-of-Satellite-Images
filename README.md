# Deep-Learning-for-Multiclass-segmentation-of-Satellite-Images

# DESCRIPTION
This project aims to process high resolution 4-band satellite images (.tif images) and classify various regions into 8 separate classes viz., Road, Tree, Bare Soil, Rail, Building, Field, Water and SwimmingPool. There are unclassified pixels present as well.

# DATASET
Our training dataset consists of 13 .tif satellite images with their corresponding ground truths and similarly we have 1 .tif cross validation image.
